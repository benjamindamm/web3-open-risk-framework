# MEV Exploitation Risk (FIDLEG Compliant)

## Risk Description

MEV exploitation risk encompasses the potential for market manipulation through MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) exploitation, flash loan attacks, front-running, sandwich attacks, and other suspicious trading activities that may constitute market abuse under Swiss FIDLEG Article 142. This risk requires comprehensive monitoring and reporting to FINMA under Swiss market abuse prevention regulations.

## FIDLEG Compliance Context

### Regulatory Classification
- **FIDLEG Article**: Art. 142 (Market Abuse Prevention), Art. 8 (Informationpflichten), Art. 9 (AngemessenheitsprÃ¼fung)
- **GwG Article**: Art. 6 (Sorgfaltspflichten - AML requirements)
- **FINMA Requirement**: Market abuse reporting for suspicious trading patterns
- **MROS Requirement**: AML reporting for suspicious transactions
- **Compliance Level**: MANDATORY - Required by Swiss law
- **Documentation**: Quarterly reporting to FINMA, immediate MROS reporting
- **Customer Type**: Applies to both retail and professional clients
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Immediate threat to market integrity

### Swiss Market Requirements
- Market integrity maintenance (FIDLEG Art. 142)
- Fair trading practices enforcement
- Client information obligations (FIDLEG Art. 8)
- Service appropriateness assessment (FIDLEG Art. 9)
- Regulatory reporting to FINMA
- MROS reporting for suspicious transactions (GwG Art. 6)
- Market abuse prevention monitoring

## Risk Indicators

- MEV extraction patterns exceeding CHF 10k (FINMA threshold)
- Flash loan volume > CHF 100k in 1 hour (suspicious activity threshold)
- Arbitrage patterns > CHF 50k daily (market manipulation indicator)
- Unusual transaction ordering patterns (front-running detection)
- Cross-DEX manipulation attempts (market abuse pattern)
- Rapid wallet creation/deletion patterns (structuring indicator)
- Geographic risk patterns (high-risk jurisdiction transactions)

## Impact Assessment

### Financial Impact
- Market manipulation leading to unfair trading
- Protocol manipulation affecting user funds
- Regulatory fines and penalties
- Reputation damage affecting business operations

### Operational Impact
- Service disruption due to market manipulation
- Client trust erosion
- Regulatory investigation
- Market integrity compromise

## Mitigation Measures

### Technical Controls
- Real-time MEV detection systems
- Automated FINMA reporting mechanisms
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Audit trail management
- Integration with Swiss regulatory systems

### Administrative Controls
- Market monitoring procedures
- Incident response protocols
- Regulatory liaison procedures
- Staff training on market abuse prevention

### Regulatory Controls
- Quarterly risk reporting to FINMA (FIDLEG Art. 142)
- Immediate MROS reporting for suspicious transactions (GwG Art. 6)
- Market abuse notification procedures
- Client information updates (FIDLEG Art. 8)
- Service appropriateness re-evaluation (FIDLEG Art. 9)
- Compliance monitoring systems
- External audit validation
