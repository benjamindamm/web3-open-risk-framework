# Swiss FIDLEG Extension (Work in progress)

A prescriptive DeFi compliance engine for Swiss financial institutions, enabling systematic evaluation, management, and response to FIDLEG and GwG regulatory requirements when integrating DeFi protocols.

##  Overview

The FIDLEG Extension transforms risk and assessment data into actionable compliance directives. It embeds Swiss regulatory requirements directly into core data structures, allowing banks to programmatically mandate FIDLEG and GwG-compliant responses for proactive, auditable DeFi protocol governance.

##  Quick Start

### 1. Define Actions
Create compliance steps using the FIDLEG action schema. Each action requires a unique identifier, specific action type, relevant regulatory articles, detailed description, priority level, completion timeline, responsible roles, required documentation, and impact assessment on client relations.

### 2. Integrate Triggers
Embed `fidlegActionTriggers` in risk, indicator, measure, and assessment schemas.

### 3. Review Documentation
Study the component guides for integration details.

### 4. See Examples
Examine implementation examples in the catalogue.
